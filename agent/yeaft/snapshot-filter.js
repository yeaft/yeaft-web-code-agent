/**
 * snapshot-filter.js — VP-isolated view of the in-memory group history.
 *
 * Mirrors the disk-replay rules in
 * `agent/yeaft/conversation/persist.js#loadSessionHistoryForVp`:
 *
 *   - User rows (no `speakerVpId`): KEEP — every VP sees the prompt.
 *   - This VP's own assistant rows + their paired tool rows: KEEP.
 *   - OTHER VPs' assistant rows: KEEP TEXT ONLY (strip `toolCalls` AND
 *     `thinkingBlocks` — thinking is VP-private per Anthropic's signed-
 *     block contract; tool_use ids belong to that VP's own tool arc).
 *   - OTHER VPs' tool result rows (role:'tool'): DROP — they pair with
 *     stripped tool_use ids and would orphan on the LLM request.
 *   - Rows with `_reflection` / `internal` / `systemOnly`: DROP — engine-
 *     private; never enter another VP's context.
 *
 * Why this exists separately from the disk replay path:
 *   `web-bridge.js` builds an in-memory `baseSnapshot` for every running
 *   VP turn. Before this filter the snapshot was unfiltered and leaked
 *   other VPs' tool calls + thinking blocks into the next turn's
 *   messages, producing orphan `tool_use` ids and Anthropic 422s.
 *   The disk path uses `ConversationStore.loadSessionHistoryForVp` —
 *   the same rules implemented here, but reading from `messages/*.md`
 *   instead of the in-memory tape. We intentionally duplicate the rule
 *   set rather than calling into persist.js so both call sites stay
 *   independently audit-able.
 *
 * Pure function; does not mutate inputs.
 *
 * @param {object[]} snapshot — entries from getOrCreateSessionHistory(sessionId).
 *                              The caller MUST NOT pre-filter by `threadId`:
 *                              threads represent intra-VP concurrent tasks,
 *                              not isolated conversations, and the LLM needs
 *                              every prior thread's text for continuity.
 *                              (See the rationale block in
 *                              `web-bridge.js#ensureDriverRunning`; pre-fix,
 *                              a `m.threadId === current` filter dropped
 *                              every prior thread and the LLM saw a 1-message
 *                              context for every turn after the first.)
 * @param {string} vpId — the VP we're about to send a turn for
 * @returns {object[]}
